# reborn

The Reborn is a class mod which adds a new character to Slay the Spire. The full set of 75 cards is planned to be implemented
by the time the mod is officially released on the Workshop; 64 cards have been implemented to date.

The Reborn adds a variety of new keywords and playstyles to Slay the Spire.

- Cards with **Dredge** allow you to return cards from your discard pile to your hand.
- Cards with **Necrotic** do not shuffle back into your deck after being discarded.
- **Infections** are colorless status cards that help to fuel strategies built around cards that reward having many card
types in the discard pile.
- After accruing sufficient stacks of **Shroud**, the Reborn can play cards that cause them to become **undead**. While undead,
you begin to rot, but in exchange you acquire a powerful permanent buff at the start of each turn. Many individual cards also
become more powerful in undeath.

As of now, The Reborn has not been officially released, but you have my permission (*wink wink*) to download and compile it
yourself. Hopefully, it will be available on the workshop in a matter of weeks.
